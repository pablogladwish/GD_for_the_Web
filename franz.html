My name is Franz Werner and I am looking for supporters to participate in my crowdfunding project for my publication “Designing with Light” which contains student work of my classes which I have been teaching since the early 80’s at the Rhode Island School of Design.
<br><br>
In order to maintain freedom and integrity for my publication I chose self-publishing which requires independent financing for high quality printing and binding of this hard cover book. 
<br><br>
The book contains 00 projects all the way from the wet photography method to the digital videography accompanied by diagrams explaining the process involved. 

I want to make this work public
To democratize art

This book will be a wonderful inspiration for anybody who appreciates art and design and to get connected with form and function. 
<br><br>
This book is a tribute to my students but also to my teachers <br>…
<br>
I had the opportunity to study with the creme de la creme although I'm not nearly accomplished as my teachers but I always felt an obligation to share. Therefore, my contribution will be to in form of workshops to High Schools, Community Colleges, and the less fortunate.

I would like to close by citing Einstein's quote: "imagination is more important than knowledge”<br><br><br>
